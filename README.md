# Note-Taker-Application
## Description

In this assignment I needed to modify starter code to create an application where we can take notes and are able to save them in a JSON file. Our starter code given to us was for the front end of the application. We had to build the back end and try to connect the two. To create the back end we used Epress.js, we had to create app.get and app.post. With the app.get we were taking the input files from the front end and posting them to our database.  With app.post we were able to create a new note and push to the application. There's a option to save the note, by pressing save it didn't only save it on the application but it also saved in in our db.json file. 



## Github 

On Github I was able to create a new repository where I was able to push all my work to. Before even starting the challenge I had to clone the new repository to the my computer first. I cloned it using my gitbash, from there on any code I worked on visual studio code I was able to save it and push it back to my repository. Once all my work was done I did a final push and created a deployed site. 


## Heroku

For this assignment we had to deploy our application to heroku.  By D\doing a "git push heroku main" I was able to get it deployed.

## Conclusion

This challenge was tougher than the previous ones but it's a great way to show off our newly learned skills using express.js. app.get and app.post can be a little confusing but at the end I was able to work on it and improve my skills.
